# GD Place 2024

On the 15<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, this website was used to allow over 45,000 people to collaborate on a single Geometry Dash platformer level. The main event lasted 50 hours, with a short period at the end where users could collaborate on the name of the level.<br/>
The final level name, as decided by the community, was: **PlaTef01ngf234j egh1**<br/>
The ID of the final level is: **112238667**


The countdown, before the start of the event, consisted of digits that were kindly created by many different people from within the Geometry Dash community. See the [credits](#credits) for everyone who was involved.

A video showcasing the event was created by Spu7Nix, and can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb71bat1utg).

## About

GD Place is a massive [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place)-style collaborative [Geometry Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Dash) level-editor. The front end was created using Svelte, relying on WGPU to render the level, while the back end (authentication and server) was handled by Firebase. 
The history of the entire event, which includes all objects placed and deleted, and by who, was saved, and can be found [here](https://github.com/PlaceGD/gd-place-2024-data).
